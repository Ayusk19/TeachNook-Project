        <h3>Taj Mahal, Agra</h3>
        <p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra.This beautiful intricately carved white marble mausoleum monument was built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Its architecture style is Mughal and was designed by Ustaad Ahmad Lahouri. It is also decorated with the beauty of motifs on the wall of the mosque. It is not only the vastly popular Indian monument but also considered the seventh wonder of the world. The Taj Mahal is considered to be the greatest architectural achievement in the whole range of Indo-Islamic architecture. Its recognised architectonic beauty has a rhythmic combination of solids and voids, concave and convex and light shadow; such as arches and domes further increases the aesthetic aspect. The colour combination of lush green scape reddish pathway and blue sky over it show cases the monument in ever changing tints and moods. The relief work in marble and inlay with precious and semi precious stones make it a monument apart. The uniqueness of Taj Mahal lies in some truly remarkable innovations carried out by the horticulture planners and architects of Shah Jahan. One such genius planning is the placing of tomb at one end of the quadripartite garden rather than in the exact centre, which added rich depth and perspective to the distant view of the monument. It is also, one of the best examples of raised tomb variety.</p>

        <h3>Hawa Mahal, Jaipur</h3>
        <p>Hawa Mahal is one of the greatest monuments built by the prominent Rajput family of Rajasthan. Hawa Mahal, also perceived as the Palace of Winds, is located in the heart of the capital of Rajasthan, Jaipur (the pink city). The structure was built in 1799 by the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, the founder of the city of Jhunjhunu in the state of Rajasthan. He was so inspired by the unique structure of Khetri Mahal that he built this grand and historical palace. It is in the shape of a pyramid and is a five-story palace. It is built with red and pink sandstone for the women of Royal families by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh. Hawa Mahal is one of the must-see historical monuments of the state of Rajasthan, and it is also an important tourist attraction of Jaipur. It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its five-floor exterior is akin to a honeycomb with its 953 small windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework. The original intent of the lattice design was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below without being seen. This architectural feature also allowed cool air from the Venturi effect to pass through, thus making the whole area more pleasant during the high temperatures in summer. Many people see the Hawa Mahal from the street view and think it is the front of the palace, but it is the back. In 2006, renovation works on the Mahal were undertaken, after a gap of 50 years, to give a facelift to the monument at an estimated cost of Rs 4.568  million.</p>
